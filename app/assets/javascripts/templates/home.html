              <h2>Meet Tomiko,</h2>
               <p> She is a 96 year old woman who fell one day and broke her hip. After she came home from the hospitak, her family came to help her as much as they could, but her physical therapy appointments were too many and during work hours. I volunteered to pick her up and drive her to her appointments and assisted her in simple daily tasks(that we sometimes take for granted). All she really wanted was someone to talk to and tell stories of times past. Now she lives in a home, but for the time that I could help, it made her and my day.</p>
